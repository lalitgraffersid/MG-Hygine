AVOID WORKING ON LADDERS

UNGER telescopic poles allow you to work safely reaching up to 10 m height, while standing on the ground
The UNGER Locking Cone ensures safer operation, since the tools lock in place and cannot drop
Most accidents with ladders are caused by wrong handling, and not their damage
Always check whether cleaning from the ground is a safe option. If not, discuss safe alternatives and corresponding costs with your client
Always insist on safe working conditions. Do not risk your life just because the client does not accept certain services!
Always choose the safest way. Ladders should not automatically be first choice simply due to convenience
Ladders become extremely unsafe under certain conditions: Rain makes the ground slippery; uneven ground or contaminations can result in tilting, or even falling",,OptiLoc 3 Sections 6.00m Extension Pole 20 FT,
